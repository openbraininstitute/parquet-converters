# parquet-converters

Converts intermediate connectome building output files for consumption by different
programs:

* the binary output of [touchdetector][1] to Parquet, to be consumed by [functionalizer][2]
* the Parquet output of [functionalizer][2] to SONATA, to be read with [libsonata][3]

## Installation

Easiest with the package contained in the BlueBrain fork of [Spack](https://github.com/BlueBrain/spack).

Clone the project:

```console
$ gh repo clone BlueBrain/parquet-converters -- --recursive --shallow-submodules
```

The following dependencies should be provided:

* HDF5
* A MPI implementation, e.g., OpenMPI
* Apache Arrow and Parquet development packages, e.g., [following the official instructions][4]
* [`nlohmann_json`][5]
* [`range-v3`][6]
* [Catch2][7] (also as submodule)
* [CLI11][9] (also as submodule)
* [HighFive][8] (also as submodule)

After ensuring the availability of the dependencies, use the following to build the
utilities:
```console
$ cmake -B build -S . -GNinja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(which mpicxx)
$ cmake --build build
```

## Usage

To convert TouchDetector output to Parquet (the output directory is the
current directory):
```
mpirun -np 4 touch2parquet $MY_TD_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/touchesData.0
```
This will produce 4 Parquet files, adjust the parallelism accordingly to
create more files.

To produce a SONATA file with synapses contained in a population named
`All`:
```
mpirun -np 100 parquet2hdf5 $MY_FZ_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/circuit.parquet edges.h5
All
```
Creating the synapse index requires a higher parallelism than the initial
conversion.
